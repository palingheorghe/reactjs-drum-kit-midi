# Drum kit with MIDI support using ReactJS 

I wanted to practice my ReactJS skills while doing something that I really enjoy and that is playing music. I was inspired by [wesbos](https://github.com/wesbos)' [Javascript30](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30) challenges. 

## Installing

Once you download the package just run 

```
cd DOWNLOADED-FOLDER
```

(DOWNLOADED-FOLDER is the path to your folder) 

and then run:

```
npm install 
``` 

Now you're ready to play music using your MIDI controller. Run the following command and have some fun: 

```
npm start
```

## By-the-way

For development purposes I've used AKAI LPD8 Wireless and the app can be used only with **BANK A**. Just edit the files if your controller is not working, but next version will be able to support any MIDI controller.
